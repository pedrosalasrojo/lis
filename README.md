# R-CODE TO WORK WITH LIS 

The file "get_lis.R" shows the basic code to work with Luxembourg Income Study (LIS/LWS) data. You can directly plug the code into LISSY (see below) and get some results in a Latex-format table. Note that the code is just an example! Use your own scripts to ammend the data, use PPP deflators, weights, and so on. 

Ideally, first you should use the sample data from "self teaching" (see below), write your script in R (arrange the data, run your analysis, plot, tables, and so on) and make sure that the full code runs properly in your own computer. Then, go to LISSY and use the structure of the code provided here ("get_lis.R"), and run the complete analysis for all countries considered.

If you are not familiar with LIS/LWS data, have a look at the links below. You might also be interested on runing some sample exercises.
