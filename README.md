# R-CODE TO WORK WITH LIS 

Basic code to work with Luxembourg Income Study (LIS/LWS) data. You can directly plug the code in LISSY (see below) and get some results in a Latex-format table.

Note that we the code ist just an example. Use your own code to ammend the data, use PPP deflators, weights, and so on. 

Ideally, use the sample data from "self teaching" (see below), write your code in R (arrange the data, run your analysis, plot, tables, and so on) and make sure that the analysis runs properly in your own computer. Then, go to LISSY, use the structure of the code provided here, and run the complete analysis.

If you are not familiar with LIS/LWS data, have a look at the links below. You might be interested on runing some sample exercises.
